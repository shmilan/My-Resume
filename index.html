               <hr />
               <p> Hello, my Name is Sheri, and I am an aspiring web developer. As you will see from the rest of my resume I have worked in social care for several years.I have been working as a social worker for the past three years. Although I l still love working with people, I also love technology including how websites are coded and constructed. I decided to participate in Udemy’s 2023 Web Development bootcamp to further this interest. My Particular interest so far is front end development in particular the accessibility of websites for those who are not tech savvy and for individuals who may need to use assistive technology to understand the content of websites.</p>
